Driver to support HPE's GenZ ASIC
-----------------------------------------------------
The driver is being broken out of the [zhpe-support]
(https://github.com/HewlettPackard/zhpe-support) for easier development.
The initial check-in will only have the headers needed
to support the libfabric backend emulation as that will no longer
require the driver for easier use.

Driver to support HPE's GenZ ASIC
-----------------------------------------------------
The driver is being broken out of the [zhpe-support](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/zhpe-support) for easier development.
Initially, this repository will only have the headers needed
to support the libfabric backend emulation as that will no longer
require the driver. This will allow for easier use of that backend in HPC environments.
